# ReactBase

A simple React app base with Webpack.

## Commands

`yarn` Installs all the needed packages.

`yarn dev` runs the project in Development mode.

`yarn build` builds the project for deployment.

## Objective

I aim to make this repo a template for starting new React projects, maybe with Webpack, Storybook and other tools. This repo is a part of a tool I'm developing to make project "skeletons".

This is a work in progress and any contributions are welcome!
